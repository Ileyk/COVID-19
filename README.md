# COVID-19

This questionnaire is to be answered by medical staff or emergency services (hereafter the consultant) who needs to evaluate the likelihood of a non-hospitalized patient to be positive to COVID-19.

It serves as a dynamic flowchart to identify the best procedure to follow, before a possible hospitalization.
