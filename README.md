# COVID-19

This questionnaire is to be answered by medical staff or emergency services (hereafter the consultant) who needs to evaluate the likelihood of a non-hospitalized patient to be positive to COVID-19.

It serves as a dynamic flowchart to identify the best procedure to follow, before a possible hospitalization.

## Purpose

Cheat sheet.

Dynamic questionnaire with optimized track instead of full static flowchart.

Decrease the risk of false positive/negative by standardizing the questions to be asked.

Data storage
